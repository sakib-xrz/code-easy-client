            <Item title="Are you accredited or licensed by educational organizations?">
              There isn’t always a need for licensing or accreditation for
              online courses. However, some programs do require it. Either way,
              people will usually ask what type of training or background you
              have, as well as any licensing that’s available if that’s
              relevant. Make sure that you answer this question by telling them
              if you do hold any licenses or accreditation, as well as by
              explaining whether or not those are needed, and why. It gives them
              the confidence that you have the right experience and boosts your
              credibility because you’re offering additional information for the
              sake of education alone.

            <Item title="What are the requirements to take the courses from your website?">
              People will want to know how to get started. You can link them to
              the pages on your website that help them through that process, but
              you’ll also want to take the time to explain it to them here. If
              you have certain enrollment windows, for example, list those. If
              payment or deposits are required, explain that, as well. Make sure
              that people know exactly what they need to do to take online
              courses from you, no matter what those courses might be.
            </Item>
            <Item title="How long does each course take?">
              Some online courses are just a few weeks long, while others last a
              few months. Depending on the type of online learning that you
              offer, your courses may have their own variable lengths. Explain
              to people the types of courses that you have available and what
              the time frame is for each one. If you offer self-paced learning,
              this is another place to reiterate that and reassure people that
              you can help them learn on their own time.

            <Item title="How much do courses cost?">
              Even when it comes to education and training, people want to be
              careful with their money. Some people are on a tight budget.
              Others just want to be mindful of what they spend. Either way,
              everyone is going to want to know how much online courses are
              going to cost. If you have a set list of prices, provide those
              here. You can also advise whether there are payment plans or
              financial assistance, or if you work with any type of student loan
              funding.
